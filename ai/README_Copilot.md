## âœ… TIP 1: CREATE AND OPTIMIZE .COPILOT-INSTRUCTIONS.md FILES

Set up context files that GitHub Copilot can reference to understand your project structure, coding standards, and specific requirements.

```bash
mkdir your-folder-name && cd your-folder-name
# Open in your IDE (VS Code or IntelliJ)
code . # or idea .
```

Create a `copilot-instructions.md` file in .github folder. See the example file in this repository for a comprehensive template covering project structure, coding standards, and development workflows.

### Advanced Prompting Techniques

**Power Keywords**: Claude responds to certain keywords with enhanced behavior (information dense keywords):
- **IMPORTANT**: Emphasizes critical instructions that should not be overlooked
- **Proactively**: Encourages Claude to take initiative and suggest improvements
- **Ultra-think**: Can trigger more thorough analysis (use sparingly)

**Essential Prompt Engineering Tips**:
- Avoid prompting for "production-ready" code - this often leads to over-engineering
- Prompt Claude to write scripts to check its work: "After implementing, create a validation script"
- Avoid backward compatibility unless specifically needed - Claude tends to preserve old code unnecessarily
- Focus on clarity and specific requirements rather than vague quality descriptors

### File Placement Strategies

GitHub Copilot reads instruction files from multiple locations:

```bash
# Repository root (most common)
./.github/copilot-instructions.md # Official GitHub standard - main instructions
 - See documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/getting-started-with-github-copilot/about-github-copilot-instructions

# Directory-specific instructions
./.github/instructions/frontend.instructions.md  # Frontend-specific
./.github/instructions/backend.instructions.md   # Backend-specific
./AGENTS.md                                      # Agent-specific instructions

# Reference external files for flexibility
echo "Follow coding standards from: docs/coding-standards.md" > COPILOT-INSTRUCTIONS.md
```

# Global Instructions
- Use GitHub Copilot global instructions for organization-wide coding standards that apply across all repositories. Repository-specific instructions override global ones for project-specific needs.
- See documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/configure-custom-instructions/add-repository-instructions?tool=jetbrains#manually-creating-a-global-custom-instructions-file

**Pro Tip**: Many teams keep their instruction files minimal and reference shared standards documents. This makes it easy to:
- Maintain consistency across projects
- Update standards without changing every instruction file
- Share best practices across teams and AI assistants

*Note: GitHub Copilot instruction files work across VS Code, IntelliJ, and GitHub.com*

### Context-Rich Prompting

Effective Copilot prompting follows a structured approach:

```markdown
// Context: Building user authentication for e-commerce app
// Tech stack: Node.js, Express, JWT, MongoDB
// Pattern: Follow existing UserService class structure
// Requirements: Include rate limiting, validation, error handling

function authenticateUser(email, password) {
// Implementation should match existing patterns in UserService.js
// Use same error handling as in PaymentService.js
// Apply rate limiting like in LoginController.js
}
```

### Providing Examples

Include relevant code examples in your prompts:

```javascript
// Example from existing codebase - PaymentService.js error handling:
try {
   const result = await processPayment(data);
   return { success: true, data: result };
} catch (error) {
   logger.error('Payment failed:', error);
   return { success: false, error: error.message };
}

// Now implement similar pattern for user authentication
```

### Effective Context Strategies

**Reference Files**: Mention specific files and patterns to follow
**Code Snippets**: Include existing code examples that demonstrate your patterns
**Tech Stack**: Clearly specify frameworks, libraries, and conventions
**Requirements**: List specific functionality and constraints

### Chat-Based Context Building

```
@workspace analyze the authentication patterns in this project
Based on the existing UserService, implement password reset functionality
Follow the same validation approach used in the registration flow
Include comprehensive error handling like in PaymentController
```

*Note: Context engineering principles apply to all AI coding assistants - providing examples and clear requirements always improves results.*

```bash
# Create worktrees for different features
git worktree add ../project-auth feature/auth
git worktree add ../project-api feature/api

# Open each in separate VS Code instances with Copilot
code ../project-auth  # Instance 1
code ../project-api   # Instance 2
```

### Feature Branch Workflows

**Parallel Feature Development:**
1. Create feature branches in separate worktrees
2. Each worktree has independent Copilot context
3. Develop features without context pollution
4. Merge when ready

```bash
# Set up parallel feature development
git worktree add ../auth-feature feature/user-auth
git worktree add ../api-feature feature/rest-api
git worktree add ../ui-feature feature/dashboard

# Each gets dedicated development environment
cd ../auth-feature && code .  # Focus on authentication
cd ../api-feature && code .   # Focus on API development
cd ../ui-feature && code .    # Focus on UI components
```

### Copilot Context Benefits

**Isolated Contexts:**
- Each worktree maintains separate conversation history
- Feature-specific suggestions and patterns
- No cross-contamination between features
- Independent instruction files possible

**Comparison Development:**
```bash
# Try different approaches to same problem
git worktree add ../approach-a feature/solution-a
git worktree add ../approach-b feature/solution-b

# Implement with different strategies
# Compare results and choose best approach
```

### Best Practices

- **Feature Isolation**: Keep related work in same worktree
- **Context Clarity**: Use feature-specific `.copilot-instructions.md` if needed
- **Regular Sync**: Merge main branch changes to avoid conflicts
- **Clean Merge**: Test thoroughly before merging back to main

*Note: Worktrees with GitHub Copilot enable true parallel development with isolated AI assistance for each feature stream.*
