package cz.savic.weatherevaluator.common

/* In Kotlin documentation it's recommended to have a package structure with the common root package omitted:
 * https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html#directory-structure
 *
 * But, in Idea this is bugged, and in some cases you end up with this error message:
 * "Package directive does not match the file location"
 * Thanks to this dummy file (and Main.kt file in other modules) this does not happen, as described here:
 * https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-365256/Incorrect-Package-directive-does-not-match-the-file-location-in-Kotlin-project
